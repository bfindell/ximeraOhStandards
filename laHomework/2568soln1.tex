Let $A$ be the $3\times 4$ matrix
\[
A=\left(\begin{array}{rrrr} 2 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\ 3 & 4 & -7 & 10\\
        6 & -3 & 4 & 2 \end{array}\right).
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]  For which $n$ is a row of $A$ a vector in $\R^n$? \begin{prompt}\[n = \answer{4}\]\end{prompt}.
\item[(b)]  What is the $2^{nd}$ column of $A$?
  \begin{prompt}
    \[
      \left(\begin{array}{r} \answer{-1} \\ \answer{4} \\ \answer{-3} \end{array} \right)
    \]
  \end{prompt}
\item[(c)] Let $a_{ij}$ be the entry of $A$ in the $i^{th}$ row
  and the $j^{th}$ column.  What is $a_{23}-a_{31}$?

    \]
  \end{prompt}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}

(a) The number of entries in a row is the number of columns.  Thus, $n = 4$; \\
(b) $\left(\begin{array}{r} -1 \\ 4 \\ -3 \end{array} \right)$;
(c) $a_{23}-a_{31} =  -7 - 6 = -13$.

Find a real number $a\begin{prompt}=\answer{10/3}\end{prompt}$ so that the vectors
\[
x = (1,3,2) \AND y = (2,a,-6)

are perpendicular.
\begin{hint}
  The vectors $x$ and $y$ are perpendicular when
$(1,3,2) \cdot (2,a,-6) = 3a - 10 = 0$.

The vectors $x$ and $y$ are perpendicular when $(1,3,2) \cdot (2,a,-6) = 3a - 10 = 0$.  Thus, $a = \frac{10}{3}$.
