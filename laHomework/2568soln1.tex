Let $A$ be the $3\times 4$ matrix
\[
A=\left(\begin{array}{rrrr} 2 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\ 3 & 4 & -7 & 10\\
        6 & -3 & 4 & 2 \end{array}\right).

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]  For which $n$ is a row of $A$ a vector in $\mathbb R^n$? 

\[\begin{prompt}n = \answer{4}\end{prompt}.\]
\item[(b)]  What is the $2^{nd}$ column of $A$?
  \begin{prompt}
    \[
      \left(\begin{array}{r} \answer{-1} \\ \answer{4} \\ \answer{-3} \end{array} \right)
    \]
  \end{prompt}
\item[(c)] Let $a_{ij}$ be the entry of $A$ in the $i^{th}$ row
  and the $j^{th}$ column.  What is $a_{23}-a_{31}$?
  \begin{prompt}
    \[
      a_{23}-a_{31} = \answer{-13}.
    \]
  \end{prompt}
\end{enumerate}

%\begin{solution}
%
%(a) The number of entries in a row is the number of columns.  Thus, $n = 4$; \\
%(b) $\left(\begin{array}{r} -1 \\ 4 \\ -3 \end{array} \right)$ \\
%(c) $a_{23}-a_{31} =  -7 - 6 = -13$.

\problemlabel

\noindent For each of the pairs of vectors or matrices decide whether addition of the members of the pair is possible; and, if addition is possible, perform the addition.

\exerciselabel{7}{1.1}\begin{exercise}\label{c1.1.3c}
  $x=(1,2,3)$ and $y=(-2,1)$.
  
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{Addition is possible.}
    \choice[correct]{Addition is not possible.}
  \end{multipleChoice}  

\begin{feedback}[correct]
Correct! $x$ has three entries, but $y$ has two entries, so addition is not possible.
