\exerciselabel{7}{6.1}\begin{exercise} \label{c6.1.06c}
Find the solution to \eqref{Ex.1.06} satisfying initial conditions
$X(0)=(2,6)^t$.

\begin{solution}
The solution with initial condition $X(0) = (2,6)^t$ is 
\[
X(t) = 4\vectwo{1}{1} - 2e^{2t}\vectwo{1}{-1}.
\]


\end{solution}

\problemlabel

\noindent Consider the system of differential equations \begin{equation}  \label{E:c6.1.2} \begin{array}{rcl} \frac{dx}{dt} & = & -2x+7y \\ \frac{dy}{dt} & = &  5y, \end{array} \end{equation}

\exerciselabel{13}{6.1}\begin{exercise} \label{c6.1.2a}
Find a solution to \eqref{E:c6.1.2}
satisfying the initial condition $(x(0),y(0)) = (1,0)$.

\begin{solution}

\ans If $(x(0),y(0)) = (1,0) = X_2(0)$, then
\[
(x(t),y(t)) = e^{-2t}(1,0).
\]

\soln The general solution to the system is
\[
X(t) = r_1e^{5t}(1,1) + r_2e^{-2t}(1,0).
\]
To obtain this solution, first rewrite the system of differential
equations as
\[
\frac{dX}{dt} = CX = \mattwo{-2}{7}{5}{0}\vectwo{x}{y}.
\]
By inspection of $C$, $(1,1)^t$ and $(1,0)^t$ are eigenvectors with
eigenvalues $5$ and $-2$ respectively.  Therefore:
\[
X_1(t) = e^{5t}\vectwo{1}{1} \AND X_2(t) = e^{-2t}\vectwo{1}{0}
\]
are solutions to the differential equation.
The initial values $X_1(0) = (1,1)$ and $X_2(0) = (1,0)$ are linearly
independent, so the general solution is valid.
To find $r_1$ and $r_2$, evaluate
\[
X(0) = (x(0),y(0)) = r_1(1,1) + r_2(1,0) = (r_1 + r_2,r_1).
\]

\end{solution}

\noindent Consider the matrix \[ C = \left(\begin{array}{rrr} -1 & -10 & -6\\  0 & 4  & 3 \\  0  & -14  & -9 	\end{array}\right). \]

v_3 = \left(\begin{array}{r} 6 \\ -3\\ 7\end{array}\right)
\]
are eigenvectors of $C$ and find the associated eigenvalues.

\begin{solution}

\ans The vector $v_1 = (1,0,0)^t$ is an eigenvector with associated
eigenvalue $\lambda_1 = -1$.  The vector $v_2 = (2,-1,2)^t$ is an
eigenvector with associated eigenvalue $\lambda_2 = -2$.  The vector
$v_3 = (6,-3,7)^t$ is an eigenvector with associated eigenvalue
$\lambda_3 = -3$.

\soln To verify, compute
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\matthree{-1}{-10}{-6}{0}{4}{3}{0}{-14}{-9}\vecthree{1}{0}{0} =
\vecthree{-1}{0}{0} = -1\vecthree{1}{0}{0}. \\

\matthree{-1}{-10}{-6}{0}{4}{3}{0}{-14}{-9}\vecthree{6}{-3}{7} =
\vecthree{-18}{9}{-21} = -3\vecthree{6}{-3}{7}.

\problemlabel

Compute the general solution for the given system of differential equations.

\exerciselabel{4}{6.2}\begin{exercise}  \label{c6.6.2a}
$\dps\frac{dX}{dt} = \mattwo{-1}{-4}{2}{3} X$.

\begin{solution}

\ans The general solution to the differential equation is
\[
X(t) =
\alpha_1\cvectwo{2e^t\cos(2t)}{e^t(\sin(2t) - \cos(2t))} +
\alpha_2\cvectwo{2e^t\sin(2t)}{-e^t(\sin(2t) + \cos(2t))}.
\]

\soln First, find the eigenvalues of $C$, which are the roots of the
characteristic polynomial
\[
p_C(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 5.
\]
The eigenvalues are $\lambda_1 = 1 + 2i$ and $\lambda_2 = 1 - 2i$.  Then,
find the eigenvector associated to $\lambda_1$ by solving the equation
\[
(C - \lambda_1I_2)v_1 =
\left(\mattwo{-1}{-4}{2}{3} - \cmattwo{1 + 2i}{0}{0}{1 + 2i}\right)v_1
= \cmattwo{-2 - 2i}{-4}{2}{2 - 2i}v_1 = 0.
\]
Solve this equation to find that
\[
v_1 = \cvectwo{2}{-1 - i} = \vectwo{2}{-1} + i\vectwo{0}{-1}
\]
is an eigenvector of $C$.  Since the eigenvalues of $C$ are complex, we
can find the general solution using \eqref{E:CC1} and \eqref{E:CC2}.  In this
case, since $\lambda_1 = 1 + 2i$ is an eigenvalue, let $\sigma = 1$ and
let $\tau = 2$.  Then $v_1 = v + iw$, where $v = (2,-1)^t$ and
$w = (0,-1)^t$.  By \eqref{E:CC1},
\[
X_1(t) = e^{\sigma t}(\cos(\tau t)v - \sin(\tau t)w) \AND
X_2(t) = e^{\sigma t}(\sin(\tau t)v + \cos(\tau t)w)
\]
are solutions to the differential equation.  In this case,
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
X_1(t) & = & e^t\left(\cos(2t)\vectwo{2}{-1} -
\sin(2t)\vectwo{0}{-1}\right)
= e^t\cvectwo{2\cos(2t)}{\sin(2t) - \cos(2t)}. \\
X_2(t) & = & e^t\left(\sin(2t)\vectwo{2}{-1} +
\cos(2t)\vectwo{0}{-1}\right)
= e^t\cvectwo{2\sin(2t)}{-\sin(2t) - \cos(2t)}.
\end{array}
\]
The general solution consists of all linear combinations
$X(t) = \alpha_1X_1(t) + \alpha_2X_2(t)$.


\end{solution}

\problemlabel

Compute the general solution for the given system of differential equations.

\exerciselabel{7}{6.2}\begin{exercise}  \label{c6.6.2d}
$\dps\frac{dX}{dt} = \mattwo{-4}{4}{-1}{0} X$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The general solution to the differential equation is
\[
X(t) = \alpha e^{-2t}\cvectwo{2}{1} + \beta e^{-2t}\cvectwo{2t + 1}{t + 1}.
\]

\soln First, find the eigenvalues of $C$, which are the roots of the
characteristic polynomial
\[
p_C(\lambda) = \lambda^2 + 4\lambda + 4 = (\lambda + 2)^2.
\]
Thus, $C$ has a double eigenvalue at $\lambda_1 = -2$.  Since $C$ is not
a multiple of $I_2$, $C$ has only one linearly independent eigenvector.
Find this eigenvector by solving the equation
\[
(C - \lambda_1I_2)v_1 = \left(\mattwo{-4}{4}{-1}{0} + \mattwo{2}{0}{0}{2}
\right)v_1 = \mattwo{-2}{4}{-1}{2}v_1 = 0,
\]
obtaining $v_1 = (2,1)^t$.  Find the generalized eigenvector $w_1$ by
solving the equation $(C - \lambda_1 I_2)w_1 = v_1$, that is,
\[
\mattwo{-2}{4}{-1}{2}w_1 = \vectwo{2}{1}.
\]
So $w_1 = (1,1)^t$ is the generalized eigenvector.
Now, by \eqref{e:exp1eva}, we know that the
general solution to $\dot{X} = CX$ when $C$ has equal eigenvalues and only
one independent eigenvector is
\[
X(t) = e^{\lambda_1 t}(\alpha v_1 + \beta(w_1 + tv_1)).
\]
In this case,
\[
X(t) = e^{-2t}\left(\alpha \vectwo{2}{1} + \beta\left(\vectwo{1}{1} +
t\vectwo{2}{1}\right)\right).
\]

\exerciselabel{1}{6.3}\begin{exercise} \label{c6.5.1}
Suppose that the matrices $A$ and $B$ are similar and the matrices
$B$ and $C$ are similar.  Show that $A$ and $C$ are also similar
matrices.

\begin{solution}

Since $A$ and $B$ are similar and $B$ and $C$ are similar,
$A = P^{-1}BP$ for some matrix $P$, and $B = Q^{-1}BQ$
for some matrix $Q$.  Therefore,
\[ A = P^{-1}BP = P^{-1}Q^{-1}CQP. \]
By Proposition~\ref{P:invprod}, $(QP)^{-1} = P^{-1}Q^{-1}$, so
\[ A = (QP)^{-1}C(QP) \]
thus, $A$ and $C$ are similar.

\end{solution}

\noindent Determine whether or not the given matrices are similar, and why.

\exerciselabel{3}{6.3}\begin{exercise} \label{c6.5.3a}
$A = \mattwo{1}{2}{3}{4} \AND B = \mattwo{2}{-2}{-3}{8}$.

\begin{solution}

\ans Matrices $A$ and $B$ are not similar.

\soln When two matrices are similar, the traces are equal.  In this case,
$\trace(A) = 5$ and $\trace(B) = 10$, so the matrices are not similar.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\problemlabel

\exerciselabel{5}{6.3}\begin{exercise} \label{c6.5.4}
Let $B=P\inv AP$ so that $A$ and $B$ are similar matrices.  Suppose
that $v$ is an eigenvector of $B$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$.  Show
that $Pv$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$.

\begin{solution}

Since, $A$ and $B$ are similar matrices, if $Bv = \lambda v$, then
\[ A(Pv) = PP^{-1}APv = PBv = \lambda (Pv). \]
Thus, $Pv$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$.
