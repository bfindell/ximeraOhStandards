\begin{definition}
In a circle, a \textbf{central angle} has the center of the circle as its vertex.  
An \textbf{inscribed angle} has a point on the circle as its vertex. 
An \textbf{arc} of a circle has both a measure and a length.  \textbf{Arc measure} indicates an amount of turning (in degrees).  An \textbf{arc length} is a distance.

\item The measure of an inscribed angle is \wordChoice{\choice{equal to}\choice[correct]{half}\choice{double}\choice{unrelated to}} the measure of the corresponding central angle. 
\item The measure of an inscribed angle is \wordChoice{\choice{equal to}\choice[correct]{half}\choice{double}\choice{unrelated to}} the measure of the corresponding arc.

Maybe some questions about visually estimating angle measures or arc measures.
